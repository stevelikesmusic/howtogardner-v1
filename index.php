			<h1>Hi, I'm Steve. I'm a Gardner.</h1>
			<p>I like to build. Art, family, music, muscles(in progress), meals. Even things that grow &mdash; I am a Gardner after all. I'm driven to craft memorable experiences. Last year I decided to wanted to make products for the internet. Since then I've been wrapping my head around bits, bytes, and curly braces. I love the idea of merging art with technology.</p>
      <p>My current educational exploits involve playing with Node and Backbone with a bit of Sass. Fun.</p>
