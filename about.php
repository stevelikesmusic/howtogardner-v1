			<h1>Tidbits About Steve Gardner</h1>
			<p>Steve Gardner is a purveyor of delightful experiences. When not refering to himself in the third-person, Steve loves to put smiles on faces. </p>
			<p>But I much rather prefer the far more expressive first-person. I play music, cook, draw, build, write and code. I try to assault all the senses. And I love to learn. More please!</p>
			<p>My first fond memories are of dreaming big. Dinosaurs. Spaceships. Flying dogs with capes. After building little motors in my parents and wooden T. Rexes in my parents' basement, college beckoned. I spent my first decade of adulthood bringing happiness to ears. Music was my focus, and my ax was the saxophone. After leaving Cleveland, I wound up in Los Angeles because California. I recorded an album and made a <a id='diggem' href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nqkyDgt4wA'>music video</a>.</p>
			<p>But my interests had grown. The web, and all its inifite creative possibilities, was calling. I read a blog <a href='http://rileyh.com/how-i-learned-to-code-in-under-10-months/'>article about learning development</a> and was entranced in the siren call of code. I've been learning on <a id='treehouse' href='http://referrals.trhou.se/stevegardner'>Treehouse</a> since the summer. It's fantastic. I'm hooked.</p>
			<p>In recent news, let's see. There was a <a id='wedding' href='#'>wedding</a> to an <a id='adina' href='#'>amazing gorgeous woman</a>. We got a <a id='baxter' href='#'>dog</a>. Now we're expecting a little baby boy named August Ellington this srping. He'll be a Gardner too. World, you're welcome.</p>
			<p>We live in sunny <a href="#">Santa Monica</a>. It's lovely any time of year.</p>
