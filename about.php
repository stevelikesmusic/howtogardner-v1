				<h1>Tidbits About Steve Gardner</h1>
				<p>Steve Gardner is a purveyor of delightful experiences. When not refering to himself in the third-person, Steve loves to put smiles on faces. </p>
				<p>But I much rather prefer the far more expressive first-person. I play music, cook, draw, build, write and code. I try to assault all the senses. And I love to learn. More please!</p>
				<p>My first fond memories are of dreaming big. Dinosaurs. Spaceships. Flying dogs with capes. After building little motors in my parents and wooden T. Rexes in my parents' basement, college beckoned. I spent my first decade of adulthood bringing happiness to ears. Music was my focus, and my ax was the saxophone. After leaving Cleveland, I wound up in Los Angeles because California. I recorded an album and made a music video.</p>
				<p>But my interests had grown. The web, and all its inifite creative possibilities, was calling. I read a blog about learning development and was entranced in the siren call of code. I've been learning on Treehouse since the summer. It's fantastic. I'm hooked.</p>
				<p>In recent news, let's see. There was a wedding to an amazing gorgeous woman. We got a dog. Now we're expecting a little baby boy named August Ellington this srping. He'll be a Gardner too. World, you're welcome.</p>
				<p>We live in sunny Santa Monica. It's lovely any time of year.</p>
