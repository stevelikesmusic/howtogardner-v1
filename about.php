			<h1>Who Is Steve Gardner?</h1>
			<p>Steve Gardner is a purveyor of delightful experiences. When not refering to himself in the third-person, Steve loves to put smiles on faces. </p>
			<p>But I much rather prefer the far more expressive first-person. I play music, cook, draw, build, write, and code. I try to assault all the senses. And I love to learn. More please!</p>
			<p>My first fond memories are of dreaming big. Dinosaurs. Spaceships. Flying dogs with capes. After building little motors in my parents basement and wooden T. Rexes that prowled the yard, college beckoned. I spent my first decade of adulthood bringing happiness to ears. Music was my focus, and my ax was the saxophone. After leaving Cleveland, I wound up in Los Angeles, because ... California. I recorded an album and made a <a id='diggem' href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nqkyDgt4wA'>music video</a>.</p>
			<p>But my interests had grown. The web, and all its inifite creative possibilities, was calling. I read a blog <a href='http://rileyh.com/how-i-learned-to-code-in-under-10-months/'>article about learning development</a> and was entranced by the siren call of code. I've been learning at <a id='treehouse' href='http://referrals.trhou.se/stevegardner'>Treehouse</a> for the last few months. It's fantastic. I'm hooked.</p>
      <p>In recent news, let's see. There was a <a id='wedding' href='#'>wedding</a> to an <a id='adina' href='#'>amazing gorgeous woman</a>. We got a <a id='baxter' href='#'>dog</a>. In the spring we had a little baby boy named <a id='august' href='#'>August Ellington</a>. He's a Gardner too. World, you're welcome.</p>
			<p>After a fun cross country road trip from Santa Monica, we are currently coming at you from downtown Indianapolis.</p>
